The goal of this assignment is to build a behavior detector (classifier), using the data in ca1-dataset.csv
This data set involves a set of clips, generated from field observations synchronized with log files. You must build a detector of the behavior OffTask (e.g. a detector that can predict if the column OffTask is Y or N). You should make sure that your detector is not over-fit, paying particular attention to making sure that your detector does not use features that could not be used when applying the model to new data or new students. This can be done both by restricting the features used during model fitting, and setting up cross-validation in an appropriate fashion.
You must build the detector using an automated algorithm. You cannot simulate the algorithm in Excel. You can use any data mining package (e.g. SAS, R, Weka, KEEL, RapidMiner, Python, Orange, Knime) you want.
